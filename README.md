## ✅ Bonus Tips:

- Replace `yourusername` and `your-repo-name` in the URLs above
- Add badges later (GitHub Stars, Forks, Last Commit, etc.) if you want a polished open-source look
- Add a `.nojekyll` file in root **if using folders like `_data/`**, although `data/` is usually fine

Let me know if you want the README customized for:
- A business/brand tone
- Dark/West Coast aesthetic
- Local-only deployments (USB drive, offline kiosk, etc.)

Or if you'd like a `.zip` or GitHub repo with everything pre-set, I can prep that too.
